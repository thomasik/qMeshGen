/**
 *  Return a positive value if the point pe lies inside the
 *  sphere passing through pa, pb, pc, and pd; a negative value
 *  if it lies outside; and zero if the five points are
 *  cospherical.  The points pa, pb, pc, and pd must be ordered
 *  so that they have a positive orientation (as defined by
 *  orient3d()), or the sign of the result will be reversed.
 *  
 *  The result returned is the determinant of a matrix.  In insphere() only,
 *  this determinant is computed adaptively, in the sense that exact
 *  arithmetic is used only to the degree it is needed to ensure that the
 *  returned value has the correct sign.  Hence, insphere() is usually quite
 *  fast, but will run more slowly when the input points are cospherical or
 *  nearly so.
